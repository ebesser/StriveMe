Users create new journal entries by sending an email to notes@striveme.com

**Problem**
Professionals work hard every day towards specific goals to better their companies and themselves but are incredibly bad at keeping track of their wins, accomplishments, and progress over the course of business quarters or a year.

**Solution**
StriveMe allows users to recognize, keep track of, and store their wins by sending quick emails to a StriveMe email address.

 - Mailchimp was used to 
 - a .env file (using the dotenv-rails gem) is used to hide environment variables (email, Mandrill, and Mailchimp credentials)
